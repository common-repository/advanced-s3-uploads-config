Endpoint and bucket configuration for <a href="https://github.com/humanmade/S3-Uploads">S3 Uploads</a>.

== Description ==

This plugin requires **[S3 Uploads](https://github.com/humanmade/S3-Uploads)**!

After installing this plugin, you will find a new menu at "Media -> S3 Uploads Config".
There you can add your S3 Uploads configuration.

The advantage of using this plugin, is that it makes the configuration for sites (especially with multi-site) much easier and more user-friendly.
Defining constants in `wp-config.php` when using multi-site can be a bit tedious, so being able to define things directly in WP Admin is much nicer.
